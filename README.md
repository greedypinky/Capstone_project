# Capstone_project
Project Overview
In Stage 1, you designed and planned your Capstone app. Now, it's time to build it!

Nanodegree students must successfully complete the Capstone, Stage 1 project prior to beginning Stage 2.

Why this Project?
In this project, you will demonstrate the skills you've learned in your Nanodegree journey, and apply them to creating a unique app experience of your own. By the end of this project, you will have an app that you can submit to the Google Play Store for distribution.

What Will I Learn?
The Capstone project will give you the experience you need to own the full development cycle of an app.

#Project Submission
This is your chance to take the skills that you've learned across your Nanodegree journey and apply it to an app idea of your own. You control the vision!

With your approved Stage 1 design and build plan in-hand, you will execute on your vision and build your app in Stage 2.

Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity Code Reviewer according to this rubric.

Be sure to review it thoroughly before you submit. All criteria must "meet specifications" in order to pass.

Continue to the next node for submission and evaluation instructions.
