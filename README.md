# Capstone_project
Project Overview
In Stage 1, you designed and planned your Capstone app. Now, it's time to build it!

Nanodegree students must successfully complete the Capstone, Stage 1 project prior to beginning Stage 2.

Why this Project?
In this project, you will demonstrate the skills you've learned in your Nanodegree journey, and apply them to creating a unique app experience of your own. By the end of this project, you will have an app that you can submit to the Google Play Store for distribution.

What Will I Learn?
The Capstone project will give you the experience you need to own the full development cycle of an app.
